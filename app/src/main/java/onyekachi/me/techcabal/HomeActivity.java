This new fee is said to be in line with the Central Bank of Nigeria&#8217;s Banker&#8217;s Tarrif, and is effective from the 23rd of December 2014.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/gtbank-N100-annual-card-maintenance-fee.jpg\\\"><img alt=\\\"gtbank N100 annual card maintenance fee\\\" class=\\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-23770\\\" height=\\\"444\\\" src=\\\"http://techcabal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/gtbank-N100-annual-card-maintenance-fee.jpg\\\" width=\\\"250\\\" /></a></p>\\n<p>As far as I can currently confirm, only GTBank has sent this message. Of course, since this is a CBN directive, it is only a matter of time before all the other banks fall in.</p>\\n<p>The banks charge N1,000 every time they issue a new card. And new issues include replacing lost or expired cards. Each card has a term of four years, which means that in the end, a card that is carried to term will now cost forty percent more, or N1,400.</p>\\n<p>What is this charge for? We don&#8217;t know yet. We also don&#8217;t know how it will be divided between the CBN and the bank.  Annual card maintenance charges are not mentioned in the Central Bank&#8217;s <a href=\\\"http://www.cenbank.org/Out/2013/FPRD/Circular%20to%20all%20Banks%20and%20Discount%20Houses.%20The%20Rrvised%20Guide%20to%20Bank%20Charges.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Revised Guide to Bank Charges, published in 2013</a> (PDF, see page 18 on electronic banking). But the guide couldn&#8217;t have provided for the relatively recent <a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/2014/08/14/mister-godwin-emefiele-n65-atm-charge/\\\">N65 charge for remote-on-us ATM withdrawals</a> &#8212; that is the fee for withdrawing from an ATM that is not &#8220;your bank&#8217;s&#8221;. </p>\\n<p>That particular directive has been in force since September, and quite a few N65 debits on my account since then assure me that it&#8217;s real. </p>\\n<p>As of now we have not seen any official communication from the CBN about the new N100 annual card maintenance fee, but GTBank&#8217;s message to its customers is as good as any assurance that the CBN will be helping itself to a tidy Christmas haul from bank card users before 2014 is out. There are between four to five million GTBank debit cards in circulation, according to informed guesstimates by banking experts I have interacted with. A <a href=\\\"http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/cashless-policy-atm-cards-in-circulation-grow-by-300-/131318/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">ThisDay report</a> puts debit (ATM) cards in circulation at 26 million as at 2012. That would mean the CBN stands to rake in anything from N400 million from just GTBank, and more than N3 billion across the board.</p>\\n<p>Some of the early recipients of the notice are not too happy. Puzzled customers have taken to social media to kvetch about it. The new CBN Governer, Mr. Godwin Emefiele seems, in some opinions, very tariff happy. Others are laying their angst at the feet of GTBank, which seems to be the first and only bank as of this report to go public with the directive.</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" width=\\\"550\\\"><p><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/gtbank\\\">@gtbank</a> : after charging fee on getting same card&#8230; Now it's time to charge #100 per customer&#8230;.

This edition focused on students from Nigerian tertiary institutions, in a bid to learn how they interact with their mobile devices. The CcHub has released an infographic that visualises the results of the research.</p>\\n<p>Over 5000 students participated in the survey, most of them coming from the University of Lagos and Yaba College of Technology (64% and 9% respectively). The research led to some interesting findings.</p>\\n<p><strong>Social networking</strong> is a major reason (89.6%) why students subscribe to internet bundles regularly. The activity dominates mobile phone usage with Whatsapp, Blackberry Messenger and Facebook being the top 3 most used applications (28.4%, 19.4%, 13.4% respectively).</p>\\n<p><strong>49.1% of the sample identified browsing on the web as the most common use of their internet data.</strong> Nearly more than half of the students use more than one phone.</p>\\n<p><strong>44 percent of the sample owned multiple phones.</strong> 0.3 percent as much as five separate devices. Network issues, multiple sim cards and extra battery life were identified as top three reasons for multiple mobile phone ownerships.</p>\\n<p>The average monthly allowance of students between the age of 17 and 24 is N5000 &#8211; 10,000 and 79% of students spend at least 10% of their monthly allowance on internet data. 68.6% of Students use recharge cards within 100 to 500 Naira 27.2% uses 1000 to 2000 Naira and 4% uses 2000 Naria upward. MTN has the largest number of users followed by Airtel, Etisalat and Glo.</p>\\n<p><strong>Also, phone features and recommendations from other users</strong> emerged as the top purchasing factors.</p>\\n<p>According to the CcHub release, the long-term goal for this project is to contribute to a better understanding of mobile phone end-users in Nigeria to enable decision making guided by empirical data.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/How-I-use-My-Phone-Nigerian-Students.jpg\\\"><img alt=\\\"How I use My Phone - Nigerian Students\\\" class=\\\"aligncenter wp-image-23720 size-full\\\" height=\\\"3031\\\" src=\\\"http://techcabal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/How-I-use-My-Phone-Nigerian-Students.jpg\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" /></a></p>\\n<p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/47778386@N00/3170277360/\\\">kiwanja</a> via <a href=\\\"http://compfight.com\\\">Compfight</a> <a href=\\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\\\">cc</a></em></p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/2014/12/19/cchub-publishes-new-report-students-use-phones/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">CcHub Publishes New Infographic Report On How Students Use Their Phones</a> appeared first on <a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">techcabal.com</a>.</p>\", \n" +

Need company on the narrow path to transcendence or divine provision? It&#8217;s 2014, so of course there&#8217;s an app for that.\\u00a0<a href=\\\"http://Prayerbox.co\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Prayerbox</a> is an online platform that lets you share prayer points and testimonies with friends, family and religious communities.</p>\\n<p>And because social features are now a popular app staple, the website also allows you connect with other &#8220;prayer warriors&#8221;.</p>\\n<p>Using the platform is straightforward. You sign up and start posting prayers. Ostensibly,\\u00a0your prayers go to heaven, but definitely to prayerbox&#8217;s servers which turns it into a prayer feed that you and the people that follow you/you follow can view. If you&#8217;re viewing someone&#8217;s prayer feed, you can &#8220;heart&#8221; a particular prayer. Or you can just pray for them.</p>\\n<p>You can also search for prayer points, people or churches. Altogether, this is like a Twitter for praying.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;People are sometimes confined to gathering together religiously once a week in most religions, and during these gatherings there are a lot of people&#8221;, says Bambo Oyelaja, creator of Prayerbox.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Connecting to religious leaders this way is difficult, hence prayerbox. The platform allows users to connect to their religious leaders anytime, anywhere. It also gives them a platform through which they can connect religiously outside their religious gatherings&#8221;.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PRAYERBOX-ozombo.jpeg\\\"><img alt=\\\"PRAYERBOX   ozombo\\\" class=\\\"aligncenter  wp-image-23653\\\" height=\\\"345\\\" src=\\\"http://techcabal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PRAYERBOX-ozombo-1024x475.jpeg\\\" width=\\\"744\\\" /></a></p>\\n<p>Bambo goes on to say\\u00a0the platform\\u00a0will eventually allow users pay tithes and offerings directly to their churches through their mobile phones.</p>\\n<p>We&#8217;re not sure how many faiths Prayerbox intends to support going forward, but right now, it&#8217;s all about Jesus on Prayerbox.</p>\\n<p>Prayerbox is <a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/2014/10/10/meet-nine-startups-440ngs-first-accelerator-cohort/\\\" title=\\\"Meet The Nine Startups In 440NG\\u2019s First Accelerator Cohort\\\">backed by 440</a>, the incubator partnership of L5 Labs and 88mph.</p>\\n<p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/87368141@N00/502363271/\\\">mathieujarryphoto</a> via <a href=\\\"http://compfight.com\\\">Compfight</a> <a href=\\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/\\\">cc</a></em></p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/2014/12/17/prayerbox-because-prayer-is-the-key/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">The App For Praying Is Here.

Uber\\u00a0has just\\u00a0deployed uberX, the low cost Uber option in Lagos, after five months of <a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/2014/07/23/uber-launches-lagos/\\\" title=\\\"Uber Has Arrived Lagos With Ice Prince Zamani As First Rider\\\">launching with the higher end Uber Black service in July</a>, the company said in an email to users.</p>\\n<p>What does this mean? Well for one, it should mean that Uber-ing in Lagos should become cheaper. The company says uberX is &#8220;a\\u00a0ride that is so fast, so reliable, and so affordable that the need for car ownership in Eko will soon become a thing of the past&#8221;.</p>\\n<p>This definitely means more Ubers in Lagos.\\u00a0I&#8217;ve ridden in Ubers so much that I have cycled through most of the drivers, and I don&#8217;t imagine that before now there could be more than twenty of them working between Lagos Island and the Mainland up to Ikeja.\\u00a0If they intend to live up to their promise of fast and reliable cab services in Lagos, I imagine they must have signed up quite a few more drivers and taxi associations to meet the demand.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/uber-black.jpg\\\"><img alt=\\\"uber black\\\" class=\\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-23627\\\" height=\\\"533\\\" src=\\\"http://techcabal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/uber-black.jpg\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" /></a></p>\\n<p>But does it\\u00a0mean cheaper Uber rides? That remains to be seen.\\u00a0What is sure however is that the price of UberBlack will go UP, by 35 percent. Before now, you could either get a petite Toyota Rav 4, or a roaring huge Nissan Titan. But from now, it&#8217;s likely that the really posh cars will be reserved for the UberBlack category, and the smaller SUVs and sedans relegated to uberX. The introduction of uberX might just be the excuse to get people to pay more to enjoy a nicer option.</p>\\n<p>We have reached out to the local Uber team for comment.</p>\\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> the app now shows new pricing information for both categories. uberX has a base fare and minimum fare of N500, plus N110 per kilomenter and N10 for every minute spent in the vehicle. This used to be the old Uber black, except that it was N125 per kilometre. The new UberBlack now has a base fare of N500, a minimum fare of N800, N155 per kilometre, and N15 for every minute spent in the vehicle.</p>\\n<p>What effect will this have on competing services in Lagos? Well they can&#8217;t be too happy, that&#8217;s to be sure. Already, prolific partnerships with local events and destinations as well as corporate brands, <a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/2014/12/12/nigerian-brands-need-handle-social-media-like-nuclear-reactors/\\\" title=\\\"Nigerian Brands Need To Handle Social Media Like They Are Nuclear Reactors\\\">banks</a>, and <a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/2014/11/12/simplepay-uber-lagos-target/\\\" title=\\\"SimplePay Is Working With Uber Lagos To Integrate Its Electronic Wallet By Q1 2015\\\">financial services</a> are helping Uber acquire users. Every week, there is a new Uber code to be used to ride to Afropolitan Vibes, or cruise to some uptown fashion shindig.</p>\\n<p>For now local incumbents <a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/2014/11/03/taxipixi-actually-rebranded-tranzit/\\\" title=\\\"TaxiPixi Africa Is Actually A Rebranded Tranzit\\\">Taxipixi (formerly Tranzit)</a> and <a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/2014/06/06/easytaxi-expands-abuja/\\\" title=\\\"EasyTaxi Expands to Abuja\\\">Rocket Internet backed Easy Taxi</a> are still in the running. And while there will definitely be more Ubers in Lagos before long, they aren&#8217;t being seriously getting undercut on price&#8230;yet. Each step Uber takes in Lagos is cause for concern, and they can only hope to grab enough marketshare that the 40 billion dollar transport gorilla that has come to live in their backyard does not suddenly gobble it all up in one mouthful.</p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/2014/12/16/uber-just-brought-low-cost-uberx-option-lagos-service/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Uber Just Brought Its Low cost &#8220;UberX&#8221; Option To Lagos</a> appeared first on <a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">techcabal.com</a>.</p>\", \n" +

I am not much of a writer but for some time now my partner and I have been trying to build a kickass team of amazingly smart guys. We thought what better way than to share some lessons we&#8217;ve learnt as tech entrepreneurs in Nigeria, from a hustler&#8217;s point of view, and highlight our plans for the future.</p>\\n<p>It is my hope that upon reading some of the things we have figured out the hard way, you would be interested in joining us to build Prepclass into a kickass company.</p>\\n<p>Here are the important don&#8217;ts.</p>\\n<h4>1. Don&#8217;t build a startup without savings</h4>\\n<p>Except it&#8217;s blogging, bulk SMS or web/graphics design/hosting which ones bring fast cash with smaller effort, don&#8217;t build a tech startup if you can&#8217;t feed yourself for at least 3-6 months. Or at least your family/friends can feed you. Especially in the beginning. You are most likely going to pour all your savings into the startup. My partner and I literally spent more than N700K of all the money we had in the world on Prepclass \\u00a0without 100 paying customers o, all we had was the sexy product, that was very very dumb.</p>\\n<h4>2. Don&#8217;t build an elaborate product if you have not done any form of micro-testing</h4>\\n<p>Do not read Techcrunch and come up with some fancy business plan or &#8220;feasibility study&#8221;. Actual testing with real life customers is way smarter. Use google docs, a wordpress landing page/plugin, anything that is extremely simple that lets you test your idea.</p>\\n<p>We built our first product (test prep) in 6 months without adequate testing only to realize that market (not the users) were not particularly thrilled about our features.\\u00a0We built our tutor market product (our newest and most successful) in <strong>one day</strong>. We used just Google docs and focused all our energy on users.</p>\\n<p>Of course now we have built a product with proprietary algorithm that matches tutor requests according to user preferences, but my point is your code means nothing if it&#8217;s not gaining traction. Often times (especially in CcHub), we spend too much time coding thinking we&#8217;re badass, whereas growth hacking is king.</p>\\n<p>Instead of building a sexy UI and layout think of the cheapest way to get the largest amount of traction as quickly as possible. Funny enough, the guys making liquid cash in the tech space don&#8217;t even have the sexiest UI. Check LindaIkeji, Naij, Information Nigeria, SMSlive247, 50kobo, Betazoo. In fact just check out the website of any VAS company&#8230;you don&#8217;t want to know how much they make.</p>\\n<h4>3. Build a team</h4>\\n<p>Do not invest your time with a shitty cofounder. It&#8217;s either you\\u2019re a Bonny and Clyde, or Batman and Robin. If you are working on your startup fulltime, and you have a &#8220;friend&#8221; or \\u201cfriends\\u201d that are part time (especially software developers, that still earn good money doing other jobs), they better be contributing more money than you, otherwise the relationship won&#8217;t last. Please have an agreement signed somewhere, it is too important.</p>\\n<p>Form a team of people who have the same kinds of ambitions as you. They may think different, have extremely different backgrounds, but they should have the same kind of hunger that drives you. They should also be people you can chill with and share the joys and pains of being a startup with.</p>\\n<p>As a team, the journey has been extremely exciting for us at Prepclass, first <a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/2014/02/22/winner/\\\" title=\\\"And The Winner Is PrepClass\\\">we won the Techcabal battlefield</a> in February, were named top 10 most innovative companies in Africa, were the overall Africa winners in the Indiafrica competition, MTN budding Entrepreneur and the Anshiza prize in entrepreneurship. Far beyond winning competitions in the past 4 months we have increased our average monthly revenue by over 5 times what it used to be in the months before.</p>\\n<p>It\\u2019s been a very emotional journey and one that we are looking to share with exciting and vibrant people. We are forming Voltron right now as we look towards the battles of 2015 and we are inviting as many smart young people who are looking to be part of one of the most interesting young companies in Nigeria.</p>\\n<h4>4. Don&#8217;t rely on investors</h4>\\n<p>Especially the ones here in Nigeria. The financial capital market is very poor. The richest guys are the politicians, and they only understand traditional business models. The <a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/2014/03/13/pedal-metal-seven-tech-startup-accelerators-nigeria/\\\" title=\\\"Pedal To The Metal \\u2013 Seven Tech Startup Accelerators In Nigeria\\\">VCs/accelerators</a> try to <a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/2014/11/09/strategic-laziness-vcs-startups-can/\\\" title=\\\"The Strategic Laziness Of VCs, And What Startups Can Do About It\\\">mitigate risk as much as possible</a>. They won&#8217;t invest (meaningfully) in your code if you don&#8217;t have any real traction.</p>\\n<p>My advice: apply for startup competitions and give it your all. Battlefield literally changed our lives. Aside the funds, the ripple effect of the exposure we got from the experience is still ongoing. There a lot of competitions out there. Indiafrica, Etisalat, Echoing Green, WISE, CcHUB Call For Ideas, MTN budding Entrepreneur, Youwin, Anshiza price in entrepreneurship. In 2014 we applied for more than twenty (it is a lot of work) and we won four. This puts us in a good position to create real value for our customers remain focused and not desperate. Trust me we are also extremely accountable for every penny.</p>\\n<h4>6. Don&#8217;t focus on building just a startup, build a solid network</h4>\\n<p>In Nigeria, things happens fast if you know someone. I never taught I would be able to get visa to a country barely 10 minutes after arriving at the embassy for the first time without any prior application. Have &#8220;godfathers&#8221; in industries that are specific to you. Be their friends and &#8220;boy&#8221; if you will. Ask for advice, help and possible strategic partnership. One phone call can literally change your user base from hundreds to thousands over night. But please make sure you know exactly why you are following your &#8220;godfather&#8221; though, because that can be a problem too.</p>\\n<h4>6. Please never ever Compare yourself to funded companies.</h4>\\n<p>When I tell guys in CcHub how hard some of these things, some say &#8220;I would do it like Konga/Jumia&#8221;, or &#8220;can&#8217;t you do it like Cheki?&#8221;. If you are a wannabe entrepreneur like me, please don&#8217;t compare yourself to companies like Cheki, Jumia, Konga, or Wakanow. These guys spend more on salaries than you would spend in a whole decade, unless you get your own funds ofcourse. They are not startups (in our own definition of startups). They are heavily funded companies with a marketing budget huge enough to allow them make mistakes and still win.</p>\\n<h4>7. Don&#8217;t think only local</h4>\\n<p>Think of solutions that scale outside Nigeria too. Ever heard the now cliched phrase, &#8220;think local act global&#8221;?. There are so many guys here in Nigeria quietly making money with international tech products that have nothing to with Nigerians. See <a href=\\\"http://www.formpl.us/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Formplus</a> &#8211; for a startup with zero overhead they are an ideal SaaS solution making liquid cash. Build apps for chrome store, a wordpress plugins or build a custom made excel templates with formulas, sell audio books etc.</p>\\n<h4>8. Don&#8217;t forget mobile</h4>\\n<p>Especially if you are interested in B2C in Nigeria. Opera mini and Blackberry (yes blackberries are still plenty out there) account for the highest internet consumption in Nigeria, with Opera Mini alone accounting for more than 50%. Ask anyone with an incredible amount of traffic. It&#8217;s all from opera mini. That is only natural because of the high internet cost (Opera mini offers nearly the same experience with lesser bandwidth consumption) and of course higher feature-phone penetration.</p>\\n<h4>9. Don&#8217;t try to do it alone</h4>\\n<p>I have learnt a lot of stuff by proximity to smart people. I am as curious as hell (I learnt that from my partner) Be friends with guys doing things in the tech space. By this I mean guys making actual money not your fellow friends with code.</p>\\n<p>If you are already thinking of quitting your jobs to become a tech entrepreneurs I hope you find this useful. We&#8217;re also hoping you might be inspired and <a href=\\\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PN-zbCXM-ImWH47myGFW_BgmTFo2NNMVk0oST0Z7P2E/viewform\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">join us on the Prepclass bandwagon</a>.</p>\\n<p>Photo Credit: <a href=\\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/13977398@N03/2252095723/\\\">Hugo-photography</a> via <a href=\\\"http://compfight.com\\\">Compfight</a> <a href=\\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/\\\">cc</a></p>\\n<p>The post <a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/2014/12/16/prepclass-tips-for-african-entrepreneurs/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Nine Things African Tech Entrepreneurs Should Never Do</a> appeared first on <a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">techcabal.com</a>.</p>\", \n" +

I&#8217;m certain we have. The value proposition of Connverg is as old as code itself. Programmers have always wanted to share code and learn from other programmers, and have been collaborating since the internet was available only at the speed of dial up. As the pipes widened into a true information superhighway, sharing and collaboration exploded, to the point that much of the technology that powers the internet and the web is open source.</p>\\n<p>From Stackoverflow to Github, there is no shortage of software and web platforms that allow programmers collaborate on code. So why create another place to converge? Why Connverg?</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/discover-people_new.jpg\\\"><img alt=\\\"discover-people_new\\\" class=\\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-23639\\\" height=\\\"600\\\" src=\\\"http://techcabal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/discover-people_new.jpg\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" /></a></p>\\n<p>After speaking with Maja Taiwo, CEO of Swapspace systems, makers of Connverg, I get the sense that they&#8217;ve built this platform largely because they can. In the course of working with trainee developers, Maja said they found that the external resources and communities the trainees would consult on their own time did not quite cut it, because it was hard to get quality answers to technical questions. Posters to popular developer forums are known for putting up\\u00a0lots of half-baked answers just for the purpose of getting upvotes, karma, points or whatever gamified hook is\\u00a0in play.</p>\\n<p>Maja is right. But it remains to be seen if they&#8217;ve actually come up with an implementation better than anything that is out there. Connverg&#8217;s advertised features include social networking, realtime collaborative code-editing, messaging via text, audio and video and workspace customisations. But when the beta finally arrives, the first thing we&#8217;ll looking to see is if this trumps all the alternatives right out of the box, and is, like <a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/author/seyi-taylor\\\">ST</a> would say, a technical wonder.\\u00a0And even if that is the case, the next question is if being better is a great enough differentiator. I have seen this happen before, when <a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/2014/10/08/best-apps-ones-use-often-toothbrush/\\\" title=\\\"The Best Apps Are The Ones You Use As Often As A Toothbrush\\\">Slack replaced Skype</a> for internal messaging at BigCabal because it was just waaaaaay better at it, even while it was still in beta. But <a href=\\\"http://fortune.com/2014/10/31/stewart-butterfield-slack-billion/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Slack is a unicorn</a>.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\" id=\\\"attachment_23589\\\" style=\\\"width: 810px;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/livecenter.jpg\\\"><img alt=\\\"livecenter\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-23589 size-full\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" src=\\\"http://techcabal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/livecenter.jpg\\\" width=\\\"800\\\" /></a><p class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Multiple collaborators can view and edit all the files in a project simultaneiously</p></div>\\n<p>If the early screenshots\\u00a0validate, Connverg promises to at least be a well designed product. It looks like something that could have been made in Silicon Valley. Maja says this is intended to be a global product, and was not built specifically for Nigerians. It is no vanity project either. Connverg will utilise a time-based pricing model after a free period during the early testing and user feedback phase. The beta, I am told, is live and will be released to the public any moment now.\\u00a0Of course, its users will be the ultimate judge of how good a product this is. And best believe, no user is more finicky than a developer.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"wp-caption aligncenter\\\" id=\\\"attachment_23583\\\" style=\\\"width: 735px;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://techcabal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/connverg.jpg\\\"><img alt=\\\"Maja, Toyin, James and Bukola\\\" class=\\\" wp-image-23583\\\" height=\\\"408\\\" src=\\\"http://techcabal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/connverg.jpg\\\" width=\\\"725\\\" /></a><p class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Maja, Toyin, James and Bukola, in their Maryland, Lagos studio</p></div>\\n<p>Connverg is built for developers by developers.\\u00a0Three of the Swapspace\\u00a0team (two of whom are women) actively code.
